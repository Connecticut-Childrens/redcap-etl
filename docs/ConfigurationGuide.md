REDCap-ETL Configuration
========================

REDCap-ETL requires a configuration file. In addition, a REDCap
configuration project can also be used. Using a configuration project
allows users who do not have access to the REDCap-ETL server to set
some configuration properties and to start the ETL process.

If a configuration project is used, then REDCap-ETL will use the
configuration file to locate the configuration project, so in this case
the file needs to contain:

* the URL for your REDCap API
* the API token for your REDCap configuration project

The 3 main things that need to be specified in the configuration
are:

1. The data source - where the data is extracted from.
2. The transformation rules - how to transform the data in the data source
to the target for the data load.
3. The database - where the extracted and transformed data is loaded

Several properties can be specified in both the configuration file
and configuration project. For these properties, a non-blank value in the 
configuration project will replace the value in the configuration file
(which is read first).


Data Source
-----------------------------------
The data source is specified as the REDCap API token for the data project,
i.e., the REDCap project that has the data to be extracted.


Database
-----------------------------------

The database where the data is loaded is specified as a
database connection string. This string has the following format:

        <database-connection-type> : <database-connection-values>

Currently, the supported database connection types are

* **MySQL**
* **CSV** (comma-separated values).


### MySQL
For MySQL, the format of the database connection string is:

        MySQL:<host>:<username>:<password>:<database>[:<port>]

Example MySQL database connection strings:

        MySQL:localhost:etl_user:etl_password:etl_test_db

        MySQL:someplace.edu:admin:admin_password_123:etl_prod_db:3306


### CSV
For CSV, the database connection string format is:

        CSV:<output-directory>

For example:

        CSV:/home/redcap-etl/csv/project1


Transformation Rules
---------------------------------------------------
The transformation rules specify how the records in REDCap should be transformed into records in your database. 


There are 3 choices for the source of the rules:

1. __text__ - rules are entered in a text box in the configuration project (not 
available for file-only configuration)
2. __file__ - the rules are stored in a file:
    * on the REDCap-ETL server, for file-based configuration
    * uploaded to the REDCap configuration project, for project-based configuration
3. __auto-generated__ - simple rules (one table per form) are automatically
generated by REDCap-ETL. Note that at this point, auto-generated rules are
intended for testing that an installation has been set up correctly, or to generate
an initial set of rules that are then modified.
The auto-generated rules will currently only produce good results for very simple cases.

To auto-generate rules so that they can be modified, use the following script:

    bin/transformation_rules_generator.php

The script uses a REDCap-ETL configuration file to
generate rules.
For example, from the top-level directory of the installation, you
could use the following command to generate rules for the
config/test.ini configuration file:

    php bin/transformation_rules_generator.php config/test.ini > config/test-rules.txt


Details about the transformation rules can be found here:
[Transformation Rules Guide](TransformationRulesGuide.md)


REDCap-ETL Configuration Properties
--------------------------------------
This section provides a detailed list of the configuration properties. The property names
here are the ones that are used in the configuration file and set in the configuration project.

</table>

### Generated Fields Type Properties

REDCap-ETL generates several fields automatically. The generated field type properties
can be used to modify the types of these fields.

<table>

<td>The type used for the REDCap record ID fields
generated for each table by REDCap-ETL</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>generated_suffix_type</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>The type used for the suffix fields 
generated by REDCap-ETL when a suffixes rows type is specified</td>
</tr>


</tbody>
</table>


### Lookup Table Properties

REDCap-ETL uses a "Lookup" table internally to map REDCap's multiple choice
values to their corresponding labels. This internal table can be saved to your
database.

<table>
<thead>
<tr> <th>Property</th> <th>File</th> <th>Project</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>create_lookup_table</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>A true/false property that indicates whether or not a lookup table
should be created in the database.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>lookup_table_name</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>The name to use for the lookup table created in the database. The default table
name is "Lookup".</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>






### Other Properties

<table>
<thead>
<tr> <th>Property</th> <th>File</th> <th>Project</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>calc_field_ignore_pattern</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>A pattern represented as a PHP regular expression that will be used in
determining what calculation fields values are considered when
evaluating REDCap data rows for inclusion in a table. By default, if a calculation field
is included in a table, then any REDCap data records which have a non-blank value for
that calculation field will be included in the table. If, however, you specified the
pattern '/^0$/' for this property, then REDCap-ETL would ignore calculation fields that
are blank or zero when determining what REDCap data records should be
included in the table.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>extracted_record_count_check</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>A true/false property that indicates whether or not a check
should be done to make sure that the
number of records extracted from REDCap is the number expected. 
This is done to catch cases where REDCap's API does not export all the records
that it should due to an internal error, but does not notify REDCap-ETL of the error.
By default this check is turned on, but you might need to turn it off if
records could be deleted or added when the ETL process runs, which could
also cause the counts not to match.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>log_file</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>File to use for logging</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td>time_limit</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>
Maximum number of seconds the ETL process is allowed to run.
A value of zero (the default value) means there is no limit.
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>time_zone</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>
Timezone to use; see the URL below for valid values:
https://secure.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
By default, the default PHP timezone on the system is used.
</td> 
</tr>


<tr>
<td>web_script</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>The file name to use for the web script that will be
generated by the web script installation process.
The file name should normally end with ".php".
This web script
is used to handle REDCap DETs (Data Entry Triggers), so if you are not using DETs,
you can leave this blank.
DETs are used to allow the ETL process to be started from REDCap, so that users
who do not have access to the REDCap-ETL server can run the ETL process.
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>web_script_log_file</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>The (optional) log file to use for the web script.</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>web_script_url</td>
<td> X </td> <td> &nbsp; </td>
<td>This property is only used for the automated tests, so
is is not needed for normal ETL processing. It is used
to indicate to the tests the URL of the web script, for example:
http://localhost/visits.php</td> 
</tr>
